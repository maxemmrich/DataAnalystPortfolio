## [Project 1: Churn prediction for a telecomunication company using scikit-learn]( https://github.com/maxemmrich/Churn_Prediction/blob/main/2021-02-02_Customer_Churn_Code_final.ipynb) 
For this example project I built a churn classifier to identify churning customers for a telecomunication company. This project was part of an assignment I did within my masters degree. The data was provided. 

I was able to get the model to predict churning customers with a recall of 82% and an accuracy of 75%. Based on given business assumptions my focus was on maximizing recall, but still getting a reasonably high precision. Therefore the F1 score was a leading indicator to choose the model for my final classifier. The classifier can be used an efficient marketing tool within different retention strategies. It offers both, an absolute churn prediction, as well as a churn ranking to use for more detailed actions.

## [Project 2: PowerBI-Dashboard querying from SQL Server](https://maxemmrich.github.io/PowerBI_Dashboard/) 
For this project I downloaded a sample dataset of a bike manufacturer operating world wide. My goal was to create a useful dashboard for top management, allowing them to have a broad overview of international sales and business development. However, they should also be able to drilldown and -through into more specific aspects such as regional performances and customer views. 
* I started with formulating some user stories to set the goal and requirement of the project
* Based on that, I performed some simple queries out of SQL Server to use the data within Power BI
* I added an Excel File with some made up budgets for sales to enrich the data from the dataset
* I built a data model within Power BI
* Finally, I ended up with a useful dashboard.

## [Project 3: Advanced SQL on e-commerce data using MySQL](https://github.com/maxemmrich/AdvancedSQL_E-Commerce) 
The analysis within this little project has been done using a sample database of an e-commerce shop. MySQL was used as a database system. My approach was to come up with some interesting business questions very close to real world applications and show a range of my SQL skills. I choose e-commerce data, because I have been working in the field for a while and therfore I had both, interest in the topic and knowledge of what is important.
